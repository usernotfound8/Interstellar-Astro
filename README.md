### What is it?

An experimental version of Interstellar v5 using the Astro framework.

### What is the plan?

The plan is to eventually merge this with the full version of Interstellar to create a faster, more versatile experience.

### Why?

To provide our users the best quality proxy on the web, and to provide our developers and contributors a more seamless, easy development experience.

### Questions?

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask Koaku in the offical Interstellar [discord](https://discord.gg/interstellar)!
